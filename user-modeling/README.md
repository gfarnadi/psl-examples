### User Modeling

## Problem

In this example, we attempt to infer users' personality. We try to predict whether a user is Extrovert or Introvert. We use a synthetic dataset that is meant to showcase two things: collective classification and fusion.

## Dataset

The dataset is synthetic and contains information about the social network of individuals and whether they like partying (activity which is most likely related to extrovert users) or video games (activity which is most likely related to introvert users), and whether they join groups: anim movies (introvert users are mostly join this group) or action movies (extrovert users are mostly join this group). We also syntheticly generate local predictor files from user generated text and image. The social network (i.e., friendship links) are generated as a scale-free network whose degree distribution follows a power law.
